Collection of scripts in various languages I can utilize

## changeTextInFile.py && .rb
**Change given text within a file. Navigate to the directory of the file, then input the text you want replaced, and what it should be replaced with.**
* Note: The python and ruby versions should do the same thing, so use whichever one you want. I only made them in different languages to learn syntax.

## createFolderStructure.ps1 & .sh
**Automatically make my preferred folder structure for projects. Default starting directory is set to ~/Documents, but you can set it to whatever you prefer.**
