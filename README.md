# scripts
Collection of scripts in various languages I can utilize.  

For most of these you can probably just go to the file you want, download the raw file, and run it (probably best to do in command line for most of these).  

I cannot promise there will be versions of all scripts in a variety of languages, I will probably just recreate the ones I use most often that I feel others could use as well. More languages means someone who has node installed but not Python can still use the program, although if I do an update to one file I have to update them all, so updates might be scarce.

## changeTextInFile
**Change given text within a file. Navigate to the directory of the file, then input the text you want replaced, and what it should be replaced with.**
* Supported languages (or to be supported languages):
  * Java (maybe I haven't touch Java in a while but could be fun to get working if I can do just a file instead of a whole project)
  * JavaScript (using Node)
  * Lua
  * PHP
  * Perl
  * Python
  * Ruby

## createFolderStructure.ps1 & .sh
**Automatically make my preferred folder structure for projects. Default starting directory is set to ~/Documents, but you can set it to whatever you prefer.**
