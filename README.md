# scripts
Collection of scripts in various languages I can utilize.  

For most of these you can probably just go to the file you want, download the raw file, and run it (probably best to do in command line for most of these).

## changeTextInFile.py && .rb
**Change given text within a file. Navigate to the directory of the file, then input the text you want replaced, and what it should be replaced with.**
* Note: The python and ruby versions should do the same thing, so use whichever one you want. I only made them in different languages to learn syntax.

## createFolderStructure.ps1 & .sh
**Automatically make my preferred folder structure for projects. Default starting directory is set to ~/Documents, but you can set it to whatever you prefer.**
